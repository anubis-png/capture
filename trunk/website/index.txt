h2. What is it?

Capture is a tool for making a full size screenshot of your Mac OS X desktop. It uses RubyCocoa and the new CGWindow API of Mac OS X Leopard to capture the desktop in a fast and efficient manner.

h2. Installing

<pre syntax="ruby">sudo gem install capture</pre>

h2. Usage

<pre>$> capture [options]</pre>

By default 'capture' will save the desktop screenshot to a file named ~/capture.jpg. You can set a target filename using the -o parameter.

Additionally, you can specify a delay parameter via '-d X', where 'capture' will delay the creation of the screenshot X seconds so that you may hide or re-arrange windows.

During the capture, the desktop screen will fade in and out to provide feedback of the screen capture taking place.
